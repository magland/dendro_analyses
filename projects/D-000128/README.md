## Setting up the environment

To run these notebooks it is recommended that you:

* [Install poetry on your system](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
* [Start with a fresh conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment)
* Run `poetry install` within this directory to install the dependencies

You can then either use VS Code or Jupyter Lab to run the notebooks.
